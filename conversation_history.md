# Conversation History with Cursor Agent

## Initial Development Phase

1. **Docker Implementation Attempt**
   - Initially tried to use Docker Desktop for containerization
   - User experienced difficulties with Docker Desktop installation
   - Decided to abandon Docker approach in favor of local execution

2. **Local Environment Setup**
   - Modified code to use local Chrome browser instead of Docker container
   - Updated requirements.txt with necessary packages
   - Successfully installed dependencies
   - Encountered ChromeDriver setup issues

3. **Job Scraping Implementation**
   - Started with Waymo as test case
   - Added timeout handling and error management
   - Improved dynamic content loading wait times
   - Enhanced selectors for better scraping accuracy

4. **Company Coverage Evolution**
   - Added Tesla job scraping
   - Encountered and fixed issues with Staff-level position filtering
   - Added StackAV to the company list
   - Expanded to include NVIDIA, Scale AI, and Databricks
   - Implemented special handling for NVIDIA's Senior positions

5. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Refactored code for better organization
   - Introduced proper class structure:
     - `JobPosting` data class
     - `CompanyConfig` class
     - `JobScraperException` custom exception
     - `JobScraper` abstract base class
     - `GreenhouseJobScraper` implementation
     - `WorkdayJobScraper` implementation
     - `JobFilter` class
     - `JobStorage` class
     - `JobScraperApp` main class

6. **Automation Improvements**
   - Implemented automatic script execution
   - Added background job processing
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

## Project Organization Phase

1. **File Cleanup**
   - Removed unnecessary files:
     - Screenshot files (Waymo_timeout*.png, Tesla_timeout.png, etc.)
     - Docker-related files (Docker.dmg, Dockerfile, .dockerignore)
     - Temporary log files (job_scraper.log)

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Converted Chinese notes to English
   - Created proper markdown documentation
   - Added comprehensive README.md
   - Created this conversation history

3. **Repository Setup**
   - Initialized git repository
   - Created GitHub remote repository
   - Set up proper branching structure
   - Created separate PRs for documentation

## Technical Challenges Encountered

1. **API Integration Issues**
   - Different companies using different job board systems (Greenhouse, Workday)
   - API timeout and rate limiting challenges
   - Dynamic content loading issues

2. **Cursor Agent Behavior Observations**
   - Tendency to use universal scraping approaches
   - Repetition of previously failed approaches
   - Mock data generation when facing difficulties
   - Code quality improvements requiring explicit prompting

3. **Error Handling Evolution**
   - Timeout management
   - Dynamic content loading
   - API failure recovery
   - Browser automation reliability

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Cursor Agent Capabilities**
   - Strong at code organization and refactoring
   - Needs guidance for company-specific implementations
   - Can handle complex file operations and git commands
   - Requires explicit prompting for code quality improvements

2. **Best Practices Developed**
   - Modular code structure
   - Proper error handling
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Version control workflow

3. **Areas for Improvement**
   - Company-specific scraping strategies
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Code reuse and DRY principles
   - Initial architecture planning
