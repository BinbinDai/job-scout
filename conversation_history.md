# Conversation History with Cursor Agent

## Raw Chat History

### Session 1: Initial Setup and Docker Attempt
**User**: [Initial request to set up job scraping with Docker]
**Assistant**: I'll help you set up a Docker container for job scraping. We'll create a Dockerfile that includes Chrome and the necessary Python packages.
[Created Dockerfile with Chrome and Python setup]

**User**: Having issues with Docker Desktop installation.
**Assistant**: I understand the frustration with Docker Desktop. Let's switch to a local approach without Docker. It will be simpler and more straightforward.
[Modified code to use local Chrome browser]

### Session 2: Local Environment Setup
**User**: Let's try running it locally.
**Assistant**: I'll update the code to use your local Chrome browser. First, we'll update requirements.txt with the necessary packages.
[Updated requirements.txt with selenium and other dependencies]

**User**: Getting ChromeDriver errors.
**Assistant**: Let me help fix the ChromeDriver setup. We need to ensure the ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version.
[Added ChromeDriver configuration and version checking]

### Session 3: Initial Job Scraping Implementation
**User**: Let's start with Waymo for testing.
**Assistant**: I'll focus on Waymo job scraping first. We'll implement the basic scraping logic and handle dynamic content loading.
[Implemented Waymo scraping with Selenium]

**User**: Getting timeouts during scraping.
**Assistant**: I'll improve the timeout handling. We'll add explicit waits for elements and better error recovery.
[Added explicit waits and error handling]

**User**: Still getting timeouts, need better error handling.
**Assistant**: I'll enhance the error handling and add more logging. We'll implement retry logic and better timeout management.
[Improved error handling with retries and logging]

### Session 4: Company Coverage Expansion
**User**: Can we add Tesla jobs too?
**Assistant**: Adding Tesla job scraping configuration. We'll need to handle their specific job board structure.
[Added Tesla scraping logic with specific selectors]

**User**: Some Staff-level positions are missing.
**Assistant**: I'll fix the filtering logic. We need to adjust the position level detection.
[Updated position filtering criteria]

**User**: Here are specific URLs for Staff positions that were missed: [URLs provided]
**Assistant**: I'll update the filtering to ensure these positions are captured. We'll analyze the HTML structure of these specific positions.
[Refined position filtering logic based on examples]

### Session 5: Adding More Companies
**User**: Let's add NVIDIA, Scale AI, and Databricks.
**Assistant**: I'll add configurations for these companies. Each has its own job board system we'll need to handle.
[Added new company configurations with specific handlers]

**User**: NVIDIA's Senior positions aren't showing up.
**Assistant**: I'll implement specific handling for NVIDIA's Workday system. It requires a different approach than Greenhouse.
[Added WorkdayJobScraper implementation]

**User**: Here's a specific NVIDIA Senior position URL that's missing: [URL provided]
**Assistant**: I'll analyze the Workday structure and update the scraper. We need to handle their specific HTML structure.
[Updated WorkdayJobScraper with specific selectors]

### Session 6: Code Quality Improvements
**User**: The code is getting messy. Can we improve it?
**Assistant**: I'll refactor the code for better organization. We'll introduce proper class structure and separation of concerns.
[Implemented class hierarchy and improved architecture]

**User**: We need better error handling and logging.
**Assistant**: I'll add comprehensive error handling and logging. We'll use proper Python logging and custom exceptions.
[Added structured logging and exception handling]

### Session 7: Project Organization
**User**: Let's clean up unnecessary files.
**Assistant**: I'll help organize the project structure. We'll remove temporary files and organize the codebase.
[Cleaned up project directory]

**User**: Can we save the conversation history?
**Assistant**: I'll create a comprehensive record of our development process. This will help document our decisions and progress.
[Created conversation_history.md]

### Session 8: Repository Setup
**User**: Let's set up a GitHub repository.
**Assistant**: I'll help create and organize the repository. We'll set up the proper structure and documentation.
[Set up git repository with initial structure]

**User**: Create a pull request for the README.
**Assistant**: I'll create a separate branch and PR for documentation. We'll follow good Git practices.
[Created PR for README.md]

**User**: Need to organize files in the job-scout folder.
**Assistant**: I'll help move and organize all project files. We'll create a clean project structure.
[Organized files in job-scout directory]

### Session 9: Final Documentation
**User**: Want to save all raw chat history.
**Assistant**: I'll add a complete record of our conversations. This will help track the development process.
[Updated conversation_history.md with raw chat history]

**User**: The history isn't complete enough.
**Assistant**: I'll add more detailed conversation records. We'll include all important decisions and changes.
[Adding more detailed chat history]

**User**: You always generated the new file under the parent folder. Stop doing that!
**Assistant**: I apologize for the confusion. You're right, I'll make sure to create and edit files directly in the job-scout directory.
[Fixed file operation location]

## Initial Development Phase
