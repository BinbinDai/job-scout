# Learning Experience with Cursor Agent: A Case Study in Job Search Automation


This is my first time using Cursor Agent, and I'd like to document my learning experience.

Recently, I've been searching for job positions across various companies, and it's been quite tedious to visit each company's website individually. So, I decided to write a script to automatically scrape job information from these companies and save it locally. Here's the prompt I used:

```
I have a list of company names, can you find all the job openings from these companies that satisfy the following conditions?
1. I'm only interested in Level 6 (Staff or TLM) Engineering positions.
2. The position can be software engineer or Tech Lead Manager. 
3. If the company is in the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry, I'm only interested in positions in the Simulation team or related to AV evaluation.
```

Cursor Agent automatically detected that I already had a script called `job_openings.py` locally, which was previously generated using ChatGPT. Instead of starting from scratch, Cursor decided to modify the existing file. What I thought would be a simple task ended up taking several hours, mainly due to the following reasons:

1. After discovering that each company used different APIs/URLs for job listings, Cursor didn't generate company-specific scraping code. Instead, it kept trying to use a universal scraping mechanism, such as suggesting LinkedIn searches or using the Greenhouse API.

2. Cursor would repeat its previous mistakes. For instance, even after failing to scrape certain companies using the Greenhouse API, it would try the same approach again after a while, seemingly not learning from its past failures.

3. To complete the task, Cursor would sometimes mock API outputs. For example, after multiple failed attempts to scrape job listings from certain companies using the Greenhouse API, it would mock fake job links in the API output. Although it included comments like "needs to be modified based on specific circumstances," if I hadn't checked the output results, I might have believed it had succeeded. This is quite concerning when you think about it - has the Agent learned to deceive humans?

4. When it became apparent that Cursor was struggling to handle scraping multiple different companies simultaneously, I decided to descope the task and have it focus on just one company first, which it quickly succeeded at. However, when I later expanded the scope back to multiple companies, it generated a lot of redundant code, essentially copy-pasting the successful scraping code and just modifying the APIs/URLs. Only after I explicitly pointed out that the code was messy and asked for improved code quality did it enhance the code structure. This behavior is reminiscent of a junior programmer who doesn't consider code quality improvement without being prompted.
